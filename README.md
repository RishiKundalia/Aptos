# SendMessage Module

## Description

The **SendMessage** module is a smart contract designed to allow users to store, update, and manage messages associated with their accounts on the Aptos blockchain. This contract enables an account to store a message and modify it at a later time. The contract ensures that each account can only have one message at a time, and it provides an efficient way to update or retrieve messages stored on-chain.

### Key Features:
- **Store a Message**: Users can store a new message associated with their account.
- **Update a Message**: If a message already exists for an account, the user can update it.
- **Read a Message**: Retrieve the current message associated with an account.
- **Testable**: The contract includes a test function to ensure its functionality.

## Vision

The **SendMessage** module is designed to serve as a foundational example of how to manage resources and execute basic operations on the Aptos blockchain. The primary goal is to provide users with a simple interface for storing and managing their messages securely. This could be used in applications like user profile management, social media messaging, or as a component in decentralized applications (dApps) where message storage is necessary.

## Future Scope

While the current module provides basic functionality to store and update messages, there are many potential improvements and expansions for future development:

1. **Message Deletion**: Allow users to delete their stored message from the blockchain.
2. **Message History**: Implement a history of messages where users can store multiple messages over time.
3. **Access Control**: Introduce permissions, allowing only certain users (or roles) to update or delete messages.
4. **Rich Messages**: Store more complex data structures, such as images or media links, alongside text messages.
5. **Notifications**: Integrate a notification system where users can be alerted when their message is updated or interacted with.
6. **Gas Optimizations**: Optimize the contract to reduce transaction costs when interacting with the storage system.

## Contract Address

The current contract is deployed at the following address on the Aptos network:

**`0x1234`** (Example address)

(Note: Replace the address with the actual deployed contract address once it's live.)
